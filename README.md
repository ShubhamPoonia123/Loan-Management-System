How to set up?

cd loan-management-system


Configure Your DB as I deployed on my local system
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/lms
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
server.port = 3333

then we can simply build and run.


Note-: We can aslo make it like username based accessable in which we just need to pass the token in header and we can fetch username from token and we don't need to pass id's in our all request like for fetching 
data of a particuler user by sending id in url, we can automatically retrive the data of logged in user.
